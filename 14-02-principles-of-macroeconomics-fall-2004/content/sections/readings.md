Readings in the table below refer to the course text:

Blanchard, Olivier. [_Macroeconomics_](http://vig.prenhall.com/catalog/academic/product/1,4096,0130671002,00.html). 3rd ed. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 2003. ISBN: 0130671002.

It is also suggested that students get into the habit of browsing the daily newspaper [The Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/) or [The Financial Times](http://www.ft.com/) or the weekly magazine [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/) at least a couple of times a month; all offer good (and well-written) coverage of economic events, and will provide some context for the course.
